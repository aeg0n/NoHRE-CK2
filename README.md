# NoHREMod
No HRE - A CK2 Mod

## Features

This mod allows the holder of HRE to:

1. Renounce all claims on HRE, dismantle it and proclaim foundation of German Empire in her stead. All the holder's vassals will remain the same. 

2. Dismantle HRE altogther and in doing so, grant independence to all the vassals.

## How to use

Navigate to your mod directory:

- Windows: `~\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod\`

- Linux: `~/.paradoxinteractive/Crusader Kings II/mod/`

- Mac: `~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/`

And paste the "nohremod" folder and "nohremod.mod" file in your mod directory. 

## Compatibility

Theoretically it should run with every mod which doesn't replace the vanilla cultures e.g. like CK2+ changes German culture to Swabian, Saxon, Austrian etc. That is because for the decision to run, there has to be a German culture.
